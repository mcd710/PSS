This is my analysis pipeline for the paper *"Moral wrongness judgments predict perceptions of mental illness"*.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15g5aD4A9eYZF1zdVnm1JmwIKYBS9XykX/view?usp=sharing") is a link to a draft of the paper (a newer draft has recently been accepted for publication in the journal *Possibility Studies & Society*). All regression outputs and figures were produced with the scripts in this repository.
